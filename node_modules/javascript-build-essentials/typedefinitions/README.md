# Why are we storing type definitions here?

They are already stored in DefinitelyTyped but every TypeScript project starts with the common "I'm going to need this, this and that typescript definitions" and you head over to DefinitelyTyped to find them. This does the same but with some common shared goals.

The files here are the files from DefinitelyTyped but they are hand picked to be some of the common ones you'll essentially pretty much always have to pick and go with. You can take these or go to DefinitelyTyped and find them there. I just find it easier to come here and copy all of them, knowing I need to do it anyway so this is just one handy location for all those.

## Assumptions

Types here fill the following typing assumptions:

* Node.js
* Polymer and/or Angular.js
* ES6
