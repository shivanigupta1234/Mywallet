# Javascript build essentials

In this repository you can find some build essentials I've come to use quite a bit. They relate to compiling Jade, Less and TypeScript with Gulp and in general the typings of different framework based stack solutions.

Suggested workflow with this repo is to add it as a sub-repository to your main repo that you want to use the build tools in. This means you'll lock onto a specific commit on this repository and the changes in this repository do not break your build chains and you can then manually decide to update if you are feeling like it.
